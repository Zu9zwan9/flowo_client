# Flowo Web Implementation

This document describes the web implementation of the Flowo app, following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and Cupertino design principles.

## Overview

The web version of Flowo has been implemented with a focus on:

1. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and devices
2. **Dynamic Theming**: Automatically switches between light and dark mode based on system preferences
3. **Accessibility**: Follows best practices for web accessibility
4. **Performance**: Optimized loading experience and runtime performance
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Provides keyboard shortcuts for common actions

## Features

### Responsive Design

The web implementation uses responsive design techniques to ensure the app looks and works well on different screen sizes:

- Mobile-first approach with breakpoints for tablet and desktop
- Flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Optimized touch targets for mobile devices
- Desktop-specific enhancements for larger screens

### Dynamic Theming

The app automatically detects and adapts to the user's system color scheme preference:

- Uses CSS variables for consistent theming
- Detects system color scheme using `prefers-color-scheme` media query
- Provides smooth transitions between themes
- Syncs theme changes with Flutter's theme system

### Accessibility

The web implementation follows accessibility best practices:

- Proper semantic HTML structure
- ARIA attributes for interactive elements
- Screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast compliance

### Performance

The web implementation is optimized for performance:

- Efficient loading sequence with visual feedback
- Progressive loading of assets
- Optimized animations and transitions
- Lazy loading of non-critical resources

### Keyboard Shortcuts

The web implementation provides keyboard shortcuts for common actions:

- **Cmd/Ctrl + N**: Create new task
- **Cmd/Ctrl + P**: Start pomodoro
- **Cmd/Ctrl + D**: Toggle dark mode
- **Cmd/Ctrl + F**: Search
- **Cmd/Ctrl + ,**: Settings
- **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + C**: Calendar view
- **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + H**: Home
- **Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S**: Statistics

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The web implementation follows SOLID principles and clean architecture:

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each service has a single responsibility
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Services are open for extension but closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Services can be substituted with their subtypes
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Clients only depend on the interfaces they use
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules depend on abstractions

### Web-Specific Services

- **WebThemeBridge**: Bridges the web's system theme detection with Flutter's theme system
- **PlatformService**: Provides platform-specific information and utilities
- **KeyboardShortcutsService**: Handles keyboard shortcuts for web

### Conditional Imports

The implementation uses conditional imports to handle platform-specific code:

- Web-specific code is only included in web builds
- Non-web platforms use stub implementations
- Common interfaces ensure type safety

## Future Improvements

- Add offline support with service workers
- Implement more advanced animations and transitions
- Add more keyboard shortcuts
- Improve performance with web workers
- Add more web-specific features like share API integration
