# Data Layer

This directory contains the data sources, repositories, and models for the app following Clean Architecture principles.

## Directory Structure

- **repositories**: Contains repository implementations
- **datasources**: Contains data source implementations (remote, local)
- **models**: Contains data models

## Repositories

Repositories are responsible for coordinating data from different sources. They implement the repository interfaces defined in the domain layer.

The `BaseRepository` provides common functionality for all repositories, including:

- Error handling
- Caching strategies
- Retry mechanisms
- Logging

## Data Sources

Data sources are responsible for fetching data from a specific source, such as:

- Remote data sources (API, Firebase)
- Local data sources (SharedPreferences, SQLite, Hive)

## Models

Models are responsible for converting data between the format used in the data layer and the format used in the domain layer.

- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Represent the data as it comes from the API
- **Mappers**: Convert between DTOs and domain entities

## Example Repository Implementation

A typical repository implementation would:

1. Fetch data from a remote source
2. Cache the data locally
3. Return the data as domain entities

## Error Handling

The data layer includes error handling mechanisms to:

1. Catch exceptions from data sources
2. Map them to domain-specific failures
3. Provide meaningful error messages

## Caching Strategies

The data layer supports various caching strategies:

1. Cache-then-network: Return cached data first, then update from network
2. Network-then-cache: Fetch from network first, fall back to cache on failure
3. Cache-or-network: Return cached data if available and fresh, otherwise fetch from network

## Offline Support

The data layer provides offline support through:

1. Persistent local storage
2. Synchronization mechanisms
3. Conflict resolution strategies
