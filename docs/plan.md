- Implement batch updates for related tasks/subtasks to reduce write operations
- Add indexes for frequently queried fields to improve read performance
- Implement lazy loading for large data sets to improve initial load times
- Create a data migration strategy for handling schema changes

**Rationale**: Optimized database operations will improve app responsiveness, reduce battery usage, and provide a smoother user experience, especially as the user's data grows.

### 3.2 Error Handling and Recovery

**Current State**: Error handling could be improved with more comprehensive try/catch blocks and recovery mechanisms.

**Proposed Improvements**:
- Add try/catch blocks around critical operations
- Implement user-friendly error messages that provide clear next steps
- Enhance logging for debugging purposes with structured log levels
- Create recovery mechanisms for common failure scenarios
- Implement automatic retry logic for network operations

**Rationale**: Robust error handling will improve app stability, reduce user frustration, and provide valuable debugging information for developers.

### 3.3 Testing Strategy

**Current State**: The project uses the standard Flutter testing framework, but test coverage could be improved.

**Proposed Improvements**:
- Increase unit test coverage for core business logic
- Add integration tests for critical user flows
- Implement UI tests for key components and screens
- Create performance tests for database operations
- Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically

**Rationale**: A comprehensive testing strategy will catch bugs earlier, reduce regression issues, and give developers confidence when making changes.

## 4. Security and Compliance

### 4.1 Security Enhancements

**Current State**: The application implements anti-tampering, root/jailbreak detection, and emulator/simulator detection.

**Proposed Improvements**:
- Implement secure storage for sensitive user data
- Add certificate pinning for network requests to prevent MITM attacks
- Enhance obfuscation techniques to protect intellectual property
- Implement secure biometric authentication where appropriate
- Create a security audit process for regular code reviews

**Rationale**: Enhanced security measures will protect user data, comply with privacy regulations, and build trust with users.

### 4.2 Privacy Compliance

**Current State**: Privacy compliance measures are not explicitly mentioned in the guidelines.

**Proposed Improvements**:
- Implement clear data collection and usage policies
- Add user consent mechanisms for data collection
- Create data export and deletion functionality for GDPR compliance
- Minimize data collection to only what's necessary
- Implement proper data anonymization techniques

**Rationale**: Privacy compliance is increasingly important for legal reasons and user trust, especially if the app is distributed globally.

## 5. Development Workflow Improvements
